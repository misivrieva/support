Support email


Dear Customer,

Thank you for contacting the support team. I am sorry that the recent update resulted in the daily reports being generated in a different format.

I liaised with our Development team about the issue. We will be able to deliver a permanent fix in the next release, which is happening in 2 weeks time.

In the meantime, we appreciate how the wrong report is affecting your business. As a temporary workaround, my suggestion is to send you the report every morning manually over email. While the solution is not ideal, it will help keep your database up to date until the next release.

Please let me know your thoughts and if there is anything else I can help you with!

Kind regards,
Maria
